Well, in my time of dying
Don't want nobody to cry
All I really want you to do
Is kiss my ass goodbye

Oh, well well well, so I can die easy
Well well well, so I can die easy
Well well well, so I can die easy
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed

Well, meet me Jesus, meet me
Meet me in the air
I think I'm gonna need me some more wings
'Cause I wore out one more pair

Oh, well well well, so I can die easy
Well well well, so I can die easy
Well well well, so I can die easy
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed

Well, in my time of dying
I don't want nobody to mourn
All I really want you to do is
Take my body home

Oh, well well well, so I can die easy
Well well well, so I can die easy
Well well well, so I can die easy
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed
